# GMOTSS
This repository includes the source code and the time series corresponding to the manuscript "Simultaneous optimisation of clustering quality and approximation error for time series segmentation".
The algorithm is implemented in Matlab and the scripts for running the different methods are:
- [run.m](run.m): run the GMOTSS algorithm for the time series in the variable ``files``.
- [runBottomUpTopDownSWAB.m](runBottomUpTopDownSWAB.m): run the algorithms considered for comparison in the paper (Bottom-Up, Top-Down and SWAB) for one time series specified in ``file``.
